# Operators
x = 3 + 4
- +: operator
- 3, 4: operands

Java operators are typically not overloaded. 2 exceptions:
- '+' can be used to append String's together
- '&', '|' can be used with both boolean and integral operands but the bit-twiddling variant (e.g. int's on both sides of the operator) has not been examined recently
