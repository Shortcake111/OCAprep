## String Pool
String literals often occupy large portions of memory, often leading to redundancy.

=> String literals stored in the String Pool (= a special area of memory).
This makes Java more memory efficient.

When the compiler encounters a String literal:
1. It checks the pool for an identical String.
2. If an identical String already exists, then the reference is directed to the already existing String in the pool
and no new String literal object is created.

## Stringbuilder
= Mutable

Common use: file I/O

Stringbuilder vs Stringbuffer: same API
- StringBuilder: not thread-safe, since its methods aren't synced, but faster
- StringBuffer is synced => threadsafe, but slower.

=> As long as you don't work with threads: StringBuilder recommended
