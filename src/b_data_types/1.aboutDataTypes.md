# Primitive data types
All numeric types in Java are signed (= leftmost bit is used to represent the sign: 0=+ or 1=-)

0**0010011** = +19 => 2<sup>7</sup> positive and 2<sup>7</sup> negative values, as 0 = positive => 1 less positive number (e.g. bytes ranges from -2<sup>7</sup> to 2<sup>7</sup>-1 => -128...+127)

## 8 built-in primitive data types:
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- boolean (true, false)
- char (unsigned, Unicode): can be assigned into int, float and double without a cast

| Type       | Bytes |
|------------|-------|
| byte       | 1     |
| short/char | 2     |
| int        | 4     |
| long       | 8     |
| float      | 4     |
| double     | 8     |

## Type promotion and casting
### Widening
Happens automatically: byte -> short/char -> int -> long -> float -> double

### Narrowing
Requires a cast.
Goes in the opposite direction: double -> float -> long -> int -> short/char -> byte 

### Wrappers
= Corresponding classes, so we can use primitive data types as objects. (the primitive type written with an uppercase)
